                <h3>Mastering Pull-Ups</h3>
                <p>Pull-ups are a fundamental exercise that target multiple muscle groups, including the back, arms, and core. Proper form is crucial for maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risk of injury.</p>
                <h4>Weighted Pull-Ups</h4>
                <p>To intensify your training, weighted pull-ups can be incorporated. This involves adding additional weight with a belt or vest, increasing the challenge and stimulating muscle growth. Start with lighter weights and progressively increase as you develop strength and maintain good form.</p>
